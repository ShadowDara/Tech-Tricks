### Robocopy

This is a copying file, because sometimes the windows explorer hates me and i hate him too!

- copy this in a new batch file

```bat
@echo off
set SOURCE="C:\Pfad\zum\Quellordner" REM This is the Source Folder Path
set DEST="D:\BackupOrdner" REM This is Destination Folder Path
set LOGFILE="C:\Pfad\zum\Log\robocopy_log.txt" REM This is the Path for a Logfile

robocopy %SOURCE% %DEST% /E /COPY:DAT /LOG:%LOGFILE% /TEE /NP

echo Backup abgeschlossen!
pause
```

pls consider this does not work for every programm, for example it is working for steam.

```
4. (ignore that 2 and 3 are missing)
5. change `file.exe` to the name your .exe file
6. These 2 files must be in the same folder
7. safe the textfile with `.bat` as file extension
8. double click to run the file

# This is the Folderlocation, PLEASE CHANGE!!!
$ordner = "C:\Pfad\zum\Ordner"

# THIS IS THE NEW DATE, PLEASE CHANGE AND IT MUST BE IN THE SAME FORMAT!!!
$neuesDatum = Get-Date "2024-03-06 12:34:56"

# Changing every file in the particular folder
# If you although want include subfolders, add " -File -Recurse " to line 9 (this is line 8)
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $ordner -File

# Changing every Date
foreach ($file in $files) {
    $file.CreationTime = $neuesDatum
    $file.LastWriteTime = $neuesDatum
    Write-Host "Geändert: $($file.Name) -> $neuesDatum"
}

Write-Host "All Files are updated!"
```
